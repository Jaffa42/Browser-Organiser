## What is a 'flow'?

A flow is a series of actions which activates when its conditions have been met.

## When does a flow run?

A flow runs when at least one of its 'trigger' conditions have been met. If there are any 'specifier' conditions, then these will affect how it runs - for example, it could be set to only run on certain websites.

## How many flows can I create?

There is no limit on the number of flows that you can create (although you will may eventually out of storage ðŸ™‚)

## How does Browser Organiser use my data?

Your data remains locally on your device. No data is sent to any remote servers.


## Why does Browser Organiser need the permissions it requests?
At install time, we don't request any permissions from you (other than the ability to store data, which firefox doesn't show).

When you try to use an action or condition that requires additional permissions, these will be requested. Currently, the permissions that may be requested are:
* Notifications
    - Used for the notifications action
* Tabs
    - Used in various conditions and actions, to get the open tabs and check them against sets of conditions (e.g. website lists you specify), and to manipulate the tabs (e.g. closing/hiding/pinning etc).
* Hide Tabs
    - Used in the 'Hide Tabs' action, to hide tabs.
* Management
    - Used to list the installed themes, and to change the active theme.
